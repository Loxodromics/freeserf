# SDL3 Migration Plan for FreeSerf

## Phase 1: Preparation & Environment Setup

### 1.1 Dependency Updates
- [x] Update CMake configuration to find SDL3, SDL3_image, SDL3_mixer packages
- [x] Update Conan configuration (conanfile.py) to use SDL3 packages
- [x] Create compatibility layer to enable gradual migration

### 1.2 Header Migration
- [x] Create sdl_compat.h compatibility header
- [x] Update all SDL header includes to use compatibility layer
- [x] Update video-sdl.h, event_loop-sdl.h, audio-sdlmixer.h
- [x] Update all source files to use compatibility header

## Phase 2: Core SDL3 Function Migrations

### 2.1 Return Value Changes
- [ ] Convert all SDL functions from int/negative error codes to bool returns
- [ ] Update error handling patterns throughout codebase
- [ ] Focus on: VideoSDL, EventLoopSDL, AudioSDL classes

### 2.2 Symbol Renaming (using automated scripts)
- [ ] Run SDL's `rename_symbols.py` on src/ directory
- [ ] Run `rename_headers.py` on src/ directory  
- [ ] Run `rename_macros.py` on src/ directory
- [ ] Manual review and fixes for script limitations

## Phase 3: Platform Abstraction Layer Updates

### 3.1 VideoSDL Class Modifications
- [ ] Update `SDL_CreateRenderer()` calls (name parameter instead of index)
- [ ] Migrate rendering functions: `SDL_RenderCopy()` → `SDL_RenderTexture()`
- [ ] Update window creation to use `SDL_CreateWindow()` simplified API
- [ ] Add `SDL_FlushRenderer()` calls before any direct graphics API usage
- [ ] Handle new floating-point color ranges for `SDL_Vertex`

### 3.2 EventLoopSDL Class Modifications  
- [ ] Update event handling for flattened event structure
- [ ] Migrate `event.key.keysym.sym` → `event.key.key`
- [ ] Handle `SDL_PRESSED/SDL_RELEASED` → bool `down` field changes
- [ ] Update window/display events (no longer nested under SDL_WINDOWEVENT)
- [ ] Handle floating-point mouse coordinates

### 3.3 AudioSDL Class Overhaul
- [x] **Completed** - SDL3_mixer integration via FetchContent
- [x] Implement SDL3_mixer compatibility layer for API differences
- [x] Update Mix_OpenAudio signature (4 params → 2 params with SDL_AudioSpec)
- [x] Migrate SDL_RWops → SDL_IOStream for audio file loading
- [x] Update version handling (Mix_Linked_Version compatibility)
- [x] Handle Mix_GetError → SDL_GetError mapping

## Phase 4: Build System & Dependencies

### 4.1 CMake Updates
- [ ] Update target linking: `SDL2::SDL2` → `SDL3::SDL3`
- [ ] Remove SDLmain library (replaced by SDL_main.h)
- [ ] Update test library: `SDL3test` → `SDL3_test`
- [ ] Add conditional SDL3 vs SDL2 support during transition

### 4.2 Conan Package Updates
- [x] Update to SDL3 core package (sdl/3.2.14)
- [x] Implement hybrid approach: Conan SDL3 + FetchContent SDL3_mixer
- [x] Update conanfile.py to reflect SDL3_mixer source build requirement
- [x] Verify compatibility with existing build configurations
- [x] Test both traditional and Conan builds

## Phase 5: Testing & Validation

### 5.1 Functionality Testing
- [x] Comprehensive testing of video/rendering pipeline
- [x] Audio playback and effects verification (SDL3_mixer working)
- [x] Event handling and input validation
- [x] Window management and fullscreen modes

### 5.2 Performance Validation
- [ ] Benchmark against SDL2 version
- [ ] Verify automatic batching improvements in SDL3 renderer
- [ ] Test with different graphics drivers

## Phase 6: Code Quality & Cleanup

### 6.1 Style & Standards
- [ ] Run `ninja check_style` to ensure Google C++ Style compliance
- [ ] Update any deprecated patterns identified during migration
- [ ] Remove SDL2 compatibility code after successful migration

### 6.2 Documentation Updates
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with SDL3 build instructions
- [x] Update HACKING.md with SDL3_mixer build instructions
- [x] Document hybrid dependency approach (Conan SDL3 + FetchContent SDL3_mixer)
- [x] Update dependency requirements and migration status

## Risk Mitigation

- **Gradual Migration**: Keep SDL2 build option during transition
- **Automated Tools**: Leverage SDL's migration scripts where possible
- **Platform Abstraction**: Use existing clean architecture to isolate changes
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Focus on audio system (biggest changes)
- **Fallback Plan**: Maintain SDL2 branch until SDL3 migration proven stable

## Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1-2**: 1-2 days (setup + basic function migrations)
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 days (platform layer updates, especially audio rewrite)
- **Phase 4**: 1 day (build system updates)
- **Phase 5-6**: 2-3 days (testing, validation, cleanup)

**Total: ~7-10 days** for complete migration with thorough testing
