# Task: FreeSerf Agent API - Phase 0.2: Game State Capture + Debug Features

## Context

**Previous Progress:** Phase 0.1 COMPLETED ✅
- All core interfaces implemented and compiling
- Complete file structure created in `src/ai/`
- MockAgent testing infrastructure ready
- CMake integration working
- Foundation is solid and ready for next phase

## Phase 0.2 Objectives

Implement game state capture from real freeSerf game objects and add debug/observation capabilities so you can see your implementation working in real-time.

### Primary Goals

1. **Game State Capture Implementation**
    - Populate `GameState` structure with real data from freeSerf game objects
    - Extract player information, map data, building states, resources
    - Create efficient data conversion from game engine to AI-friendly format

2. **Debug Mode Implementation**
    - Add command line arguments for AI observation and testing
    - Implement AI logging system for development visibility
    - Enable running games with AI players for validation

### Why These Together?

Game state capture produces the data, debug logging makes it visible. Together they provide complete observability into whether your implementation is working correctly.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Game State Capture (`src/ai/agent-integration.cc`)

Implement the `capture_game_state()` function to populate `GameState` from real game objects:

#### **Player State Extraction:**
```cpp
GameState AgentIntegration::capture_game_state(const Game* game, const Player* player) {
    GameState state{};
    
    // Game timing
    state.game_tick = game->get_tick();
    state.game_speed = game->get_game_speed();
    
    // Self player state
    state.self.player_index = player->get_index();
    state.self.is_human = !player->is_ai();
    state.self.has_castle = player->has_castle();
    
    // Extract resources (26 types)
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
        state.self.resource_counts[i] = player->get_resource_count(static_cast<Resource::Type>(i));
        // Extract other resource data...
    }
    
    // Extract buildings, territory, military, etc.
    // ... implementation needed
    
    return state;
}
```

#### **Required Data Extraction:**
- **Resources:** All 26 resource types from player inventory
- **Buildings:** Count, positions, types from player's building collection
- **Territory:** Owned map positions from map ownership data
- **Military:** Knight counts, castle status, morale from player military state
- **Map Info:** Terrain, elevation, ownership from game map
- **Global Info:** Player counts, game status, performance data

### 2. Debug Mode Implementation

#### **Command Line Arguments (`src/main.cc` or equivalent):**
Add parsing for:
- `--ai-debug`: Enable AI decision logging
- `--ai-players=N`: Set number of AI players (1-4)

```cpp
// Add to existing command line parsing
bool ai_debug_mode = false;
int ai_player_count = 0;

// Parse arguments
for (int i = 1; i < argc; ++i) {
    std::string arg = argv[i];
    if (arg == "--ai-debug") {
        ai_debug_mode = true;
    } else if (arg.starts_with("--ai-players=")) {
        ai_player_count = std::stoi(arg.substr(13));
    }
}
```

#### **AI Logging System:**
Create simple logging with prefixes using existing freeSerf logging:

```cpp
// In agent-integration.cc or new ai-logger.cc file
class AILogger {
public:
    static void set_debug_enabled(bool enabled);
    static void log_agent_attached(int player_id, const std::string& agent_name);
    static void log_action_taken(int player_id, const AIAction& action);
    static void log_action_result(int player_id, const AIAction& action, bool success, const std::string& reason);
    static void log_game_state_summary(const GameState& state, int tick);
    
private:
    static bool debug_enabled;
};

// Usage example:
AILogger::log_action_taken(player->get_index(), action);
// Output: [AI-ACTION] Player1: BUILD_CASTLE(32,32) priority=1.0
```

#### **Player Setup for AI:**
Implement function to configure specified players as AI:

```cpp
// In agent-integration.cc
void AgentIntegration::setup_ai_players(Game* game, int ai_count) {
    for (int i = 0; i < ai_count && i < game->get_player_count(); ++i) {
        Player* player = game->get_player(i);
        if (player) {
            // Try to set player as AI (may need to work around restrictions)
            auto agent = AgentFactory::create_scripted_agent();
            attach_agent(player, std::move(agent));
            AILogger::log_agent_attached(i, agent->get_agent_name());
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Integration Points

#### **Game Initialization:**
Hook into game startup to configure AI players:

```cpp
// In game initialization code
if (ai_player_count > 0) {
    AgentIntegration::setup_ai_players(game, ai_player_count);
}
AILogger::set_debug_enabled(ai_debug_mode);
```

#### **Player Update Integration:**
Ensure `Player::update()` calls agent system:

```cpp
// In src/player.cc Player::update() method
void Player::update(Game* game) {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // Agent integration point
    if (PlayerAgentExtensions::has_agent(this)) {
        PlayerAgentExtensions::update_agent_player(this, game, tick_delta);
    }
    
    // ... rest of existing code ...
}
```

## Expected Debug Output

When running `./freeserf --ai-debug --ai-players=1`, you should see:

```
[AI-DEBUG] Game started with 1 AI players
[AI-DEBUG] Player1: ScriptedAgent attached
[AI-ACTION] Player1: BUILD_CASTLE(32,32) priority=1.0 confidence=1.0
[AI-RESULT] Player1: BUILD_CASTLE -> SUCCESS (reward: +100.0)
[AI-STATE] Tick 50: Player1 - Logs:0, Stones:6, Buildings:1, Territory:7tiles
[AI-ACTION] Player1: BUILD_FORESTER(35,30) priority=0.6 confidence=1.0
[AI-RESULT] Player1: BUILD_FORESTER -> SUCCESS (reward: +5.0)
[AI-STATE] Tick 100: Player1 - Logs:0, Stones:5, Buildings:2, Territory:12tiles
[AI-ACTION] Player1: BUILD_LUMBERJACK(37,28) priority=0.7 confidence=1.0
[AI-RESULT] Player1: BUILD_LUMBERJACK -> SUCCESS (reward: +5.0)
[AI-STATE] Tick 150: Player1 - Logs:2, Stones:4, Buildings:3, Territory:15tiles
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Game State Data Extraction
1. Study existing freeSerf Player, Game, and Map classes
2. Implement data extraction for each GameState field
3. Test with simple debug output to verify data accuracy
4. Handle edge cases (null pointers, uninitialized data)

### Step 2: Debug Infrastructure
1. Add command line argument parsing
2. Implement AILogger class with prefixed output
3. Create player setup function for AI configuration
4. Test command line arguments work correctly

### Step 3: Integration Testing
1. Modify Player::update() to call agent system
2. Hook debug setup into game initialization
3. Test end-to-end: command line → AI players → logging
4. Verify game state data appears correctly in logs

### Step 4: Validation and Polish
1. Test with MockAgent to ensure integration works
2. Verify game state capture accuracy by comparing with actual game
3. Test performance impact of logging and state capture
4. Ensure no crashes with AI players active

### Next Steps

Phase 0.2 provides a **solid foundation** for Phase 0.3: Action Execution Framework with:
- Working game state capture
- Complete debug visibility
- Agent lifecycle management
- Performance monitoring infrastructure

**Phase 0.2 is COMPLETE and ready for Phase 0.3! 🎯**

## Implementation Notes

- **Start with simple data extraction** - get basic player resources first
- **Use existing freeSerf data structures** - don't reinvent, just extract
- **Test incrementally** - add logging early so you can see what's working
- **Handle edge cases** - null pointers, uninitialized players, etc.
- **Keep it simple** - basic logging is better than complex logging that doesn't work

Focus on getting a working end-to-end system where you can see the AI making decisions and the game state progressing through debug output. This will validate your implementation and provide foundation for Phase 0.3.
